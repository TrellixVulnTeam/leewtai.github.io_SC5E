# Statistics Concept Inventory

A concept inventory is a battery of questions that test a student's understanding
rather than knowledge of procedures from a topic.

To construct these, people often leverage past questions that are known to have
mixed understandings to highlight misconceptions.

I believe we can also leverage the deconstruction of our concepts to help construct
problems that prevent people from "pattern matching" problems.

The idea is to have a single concept be explained in English, math, and code.
However, the document should cover 3 levels of audience: MA, BA, and users.

## Concepts
- [Summarizing data](summ/README.md)
- [Standard Error](se/README.md)

### How to make concept change?
- dissatisfaction with the old concept
- the new concept is intelligible
- the new concept is plausible
- the new concept is fruitful

- beliefs are relational entities, concepts are bigger?
