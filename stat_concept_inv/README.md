# Statistics Concept Inventory

A concept inventory is a battery of questions that test a student's understanding
rather than knowledge of procedures from a topic.

To construct these, people often leverage past questions that are known to have
mixed understandings to highlight misconceptions.

I believe we can also deconstruct applied problems into combinations of statistical concepts
that can counter students from "pattern matching" problems, given pattern matching
tends to occur in the context where there's a one to one mapping between concept to problems.
In other words, the combinatorial nature of these problems should deter students
from pattern matching problems and actually understanding the concepts.

## Concepts
- [Summarizing data](summ/README.md)
- [Standard Error](se/README.md)

### How to make concept change?
- dissatisfaction with the old concept
- the new concept is intelligible
- the new concept is plausible
- the new concept is fruitful

- beliefs are relational entities, concepts are bigger?
