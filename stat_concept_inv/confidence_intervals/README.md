# Rebranding confidence intervals and a new approach to teaching them

Confidence interval is one of the most popular yet also most misunderstood concepts in
statistics. Most practictioners confuse confidence intervals with credible intervals.
Even Statisticians confuse these interpretations sometimes (citation). This paper
argues that rebranding and teaching the confidence interval differently can alleviate
this misunderstanding.

The first proposal is to rebrand the confidence interval as not-rejected intervals.
The first reason for this rebranding is a simple word association for students. The word
"confidence" only appears in reference to confidence intervals (or confidence levels)
where "fail to reject", rejection regions, probability to reject are common place.
The second reason is precision about the interval's purpose. Practictioners commonly "accept" the null hypothesis
when the confidence interval fails to reject the null.
