# Faculty changes over time

One of the key initiatives to advance our diversity, equity, and
inclusion targets is to collect data on the faculty population.

The ideal statistics would be comparable to other schools and national
statistics. However, these statistics are likely self-reported (to be
verified).

One way is to scrape faculty pages for different departments, then
use image classifiers to identify the gender of different faculty
members. The pages archived on [wayback machine](http://wayback.archive.org)
could be used to infer the changes of faculty composition over time.
