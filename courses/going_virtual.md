# Going Virtual

My basic tips on teaching online:
- Flip the classroom so lectures are pre-recorded and put more time in discussion section
- Your recorded lectures should show your face
- You need to get students working first before they can breakout into different rooms
- Students should share their faces in breakout rooms
- The instructor(s) need to go around to different breakout rooms to check-in on people's status

## Tools for recording lectures
Here is my open source setup:
- I use [Seashore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seashore_(software)) as my blackboard.
- I use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on Firefox for my computing tasks.
- I did spend money on [a Wacom tablet](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos-pro)
- I did spend money on [a Logitech G635 headset with a microphone](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-audio/g635-7-1-surround-sound-gaming-headset.981-000748.html) which is pretty comfortable. A friend recommended against a super fancy mic because
  they can pick up very small vibrations from your floor (I live in NYC Chinatown).
- I used [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) to make "live-stream-like" videos
  to switch between different screens while keeping my face shown.
  - Note, this is NOT a video editor
- I uploaded my videos on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) because it has a reasonable free-version.
  Here's [an example lecture](https://vimeo.com/408097921) I've uploaded.

## Designing the discussion
A lot more planning is necessary around the discussion
- The section should be at most 2 problems that can be broken into different steps.
- The problems should be somewhat open-ended that requires some exploration from the students.
- I would try to "start" the problem with the entire class before going into breakout rooms.
- Definitely switch breakout rooms every 2 minutes so you don't end up working on the problem.
