# Applied Data Mining
UN3106 - Spring 2021

### Learning outcomes
- Gain an intuitive understanding of basic machine learning methods
- Understand how fitting models can help explore patterns in data
- Assess model accuracy or clustering in different usecases

## Overview
This course is meant to be a machine learning course for students on the
applied track but the title implies some emphasis on merging multiple
data sources and discovering patterns within them.

### Logistics
Lectures:
  [TuTh 4:10pm - 5:25pm, Zoom Link on Canvas](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/APPLIED%20STATISTICAL%20COMPUTING)

Office Hours:
  - Wayne: by appointment via Google Invites

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-100], you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+'s in this class.

#### - Homeworks (20%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
  - Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. If you missed Homework0 because you enrolled late, this prevents you from receiving 0.
#### - Projects (70%)
  - Late projects will be penalized by 50% for each day it's late.
  - Projects should be submitted on Canvas
#### - Participation (10%)
  - Instead of attendance, in class activities, recorded through Canvas, is how we'll grade this.
  - To pass the class, you must have at least 50% here.


### Prerequisites
- An introductory statistics class
  - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
  - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, etc
- A computing course involving data wrangling and visualization
- A modeling course that estimated parameters from data
