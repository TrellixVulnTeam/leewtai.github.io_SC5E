# Project Searachable "Tytle" with Unique Spelling

#### Opportunity

Communication is no longer done solely through text. With the rise of social media,
communication through emojis, gifs, video clips (e.g. TikTok) are on the rise where
traditional Natural Languages Processing (NLP) methods no longer apply.

Deep learning methods have seen a lot of sucecss in automatically extracting features
from images. Is it possible to generate a bag-of-words equivalent for video?

#### Current State

ABC et al. have collected motion tracking data from actors based on emotional prompts.
These methods do not scale to motion data recorded on video.

XYZ et al. have developed an opensource object-recognition library that can quickly
infer different moving entities within a video. Emotion was not extracted as a possible
feature within this body of work.


#### People, roles, and contacts

- Project Owner(s)
- Data Scientist(s)
- Stakeholder(s)
- Subject Matter Expert(s)

#### Requirements and metrics

- Deliverable
  - A documented library that ingests any video of people moving that can then
    correct identifying all the individuals then predict their emotional state.
- Coverage for test video files - 95%
- Precision controlling for recall being at least 50%
