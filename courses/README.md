## Courses

My professional background started in research, customer-facing data science models,
data quality, then finally consulting. My teaching philosophy is highly influenced by
this. I believe students need to learn to turn ideas into mathematically
definitions, then into executable code with actual data.

Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to **recognize problems** and
  know the appropriate technical words to search for solutions e.g.
  if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the
  problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address
  issues with heteroskedasticity. This is limited to "well-known" problems.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of
  the art methods and perform minor tweaks on existing algorithms.
- A PhD student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems


#### [Statistical Computing](stat_computing/README.md)
Statistical computing focuses on data manipulation, simulation, and data visualization.
The goal is to develop the necessary skills for you to verify the various statistical
concepts you've learned and will learn in the future.

- 2102 Applied Statistical Computing
  - This class is designed for sophomores in college who will not major in Statistics.
    It assumes you have no experience in computing but one class in introductory statistics.
- 4206/5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science
  - This class is designed for people who already have some mastery in Statistics.
    It not only introduces computational concepts through statistical applications but
    also introduces a few data science ideas by asking students to think about the
    outcome

#### [Linearity Regression](linear_regression/README.md)
Linear regression is the most foundational tool in machine learning and
multivariate statistics. It demonstrates the simplest "model" that connects
problems to data and the challenges faced by fancier models.

- 2103 Applied Linear Regression
  - This course is designed for people who are less mathematical but have
    a computational background.
- 4205/5205 Linear Regression
  - This course is designed for people who want both a deep mathematical
    and computational study of regression.


#### [Applied Statistics](applied_methods/README.md)
There is no class that can teach you all the "applied statistical methods" out there.
This is a topics course that introduces methods that tackle data collection to dealing
with dependent data, to censored datasets, to finally topics on some causal inference.

- 3105 Applied Statistical Methods

#### [Pre-Research Seminar](../pre_research/README.md)
This seminar is meant to give students who are interested in statistical research some basic
experience and skills before pursuing research with research faculty (possibly non-Statistics
faculty). The goal is for you to identify a professor and initiate research towards the end
of the semester.

#### Ideas for future courses:
- Spatial statistics
- Data mining as a deep dive exercise, contrast with causal inference
- Data science class?
  - Data quality
  - Interactions between models
  - Communication and consulting
  - Data science for social workers

## Miscellaneous Teaching Materials

#### Going Virtual
In 2019, COVID-19 has forced students to learn remotely. To accommodate this,
I've made some [videos using open-sourced software](going_virtual.md). 

#### Self reflection on teaching
Here are some unorganized [self-reflections from teaching](teaching-reflections.md) semester to semester.
These are meant for myself but feel free to read them.
