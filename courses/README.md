## Courses

#### Statistical Computing
Statistical computing focuses on data manipulation, simulation, and data visualization.
The goal is to develop the necessary skills for you to verify the various statistical
concepts you've learned and will learn in the future.

- 2102 Applied Statistical Computing

- 4206/5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science

#### Linearity Regression
Linear regression is the most foundational tool in machine learning and
multivariate statistics. It demonstrates the simplest "model" that connects
problems to data and the challenges faced by fancier models.

- 2103 Applied Linear Regression
  - This course is designed for people who are less mathematical but have
    a computational background.
- 4205/5205 Linear Regression
  - This course is designed for people who want both a deep mathematical
    and computational study of regression.


#### Applied Statistics
There is no class that can teach you all the "applied statistical methods" out there.
This is a topics course that introduces methods that tackle data collection to dealing
with dependent data, to censored datasets, to finally topics on some causal inference.

- 3105 Applied Statistical Methods


## Expectations for different degrees
Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to **recognize problems** and
  know the appropriate technical words to search for solutions e.g.
  if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the
  problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address
  issues with heteroskedasticity. This is limited to "well-known" problems.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of
  the art methods and perform minor tweaks on existing algorithms.
- A PhD student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems

## Self reflection on teaching
Here are some [self-reflections from teaching](teaching-reflections.md) semester to semester.
The goal is to give you a sense that teaching isn't easy and I'm very open to feedback.


## Ideas for future courses:
- Spatial statistics
- Data mining as a deep dive exercise, contrast with causal inference
- Data science class?
  - Data science for social workers
