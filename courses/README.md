## Instruction Notes to Myself
A topic/concept can be introduced by
- Challenging an existing misconception, e.g. there are more than one way to have a "best fit line" going through a scatter plot.
- Encountering limitations while solving a problem, e.g. not knowing how to incorporate the signal from correlated errors
- Presenting the overall theory then demonstrate applications as special cases (classic lecture), the Generalized Linear Models
  has linear regression and logistic regression as special cases.


## Expectations for different degrees
Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to recognize problems, e.g.
  if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the
  problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address
  issues with heteroskedasticity.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of
  the art methods and perform minor tweaks on existing algorithms
- A phd student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems

## Self reflection on teaching
Here are some [self-reflections from teaching](teaching-reflections.md) semester to semester.
The goal is to give you a sense that teaching isn't easy and I'm very open to feedback.


## Ideas for future courses:
- Spatial statistics
- Data mining as a deep dive exercise, contrast with causal inference
- Data science class?
- Data science for social workers or dancers
