# Courses

Here're some courses I've taught before that will hopefully be decomposed into a concept map
for statistics.

- [Linear regression](linear_regression/README.md) for minors and majors the level of depth and speed are very different
- [Applied Statistical Computing](stat_computing/README.md) for minors and people who are not comfortable with the Command Line 

## Instruction Style Notes to Myself
A topic/concept can be introduced by
- Challenging an existing misconception, e.g. there are more than one way to have a "best fit line" going through a scatter plot.
- Encountering limitations while solving a problem, e.g. not knowing how to incorporate the signal from correlated errors
- Presenting the overall theory then demonstrate applications as special cases (classic lecture), the Generalized Linear Models
  has linear regression and logistic regression as special cases.

## Going virtual
When Columbia went virtual, I had a few changes to my usual courses:
- Flipped the classroom, i.e. record lectures for students to watch at home and made lectures more like discussion section with problems.
- In-class participation surveys were no longer real time but "due before next lecture" to encourage people to keep up.
- Exams were take-home, open book, open internet, open notes (24hr for 70 min exam or 48 hr for a 3 hr exam).
- I should use [breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313) more.
- I've written up [more details and thoughts setup in a separate page](going_virtual.md)

## Expectations for different degrees
Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to recognize problems, e.g.
  if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the
  problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address
  issues with heteroskedasticity.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of
  the art methods and perform minor tweaks on existing algorithms
- A phd student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems

## Self reflection on teaching
Here are some [self-reflections from teaching](teaching-reflections.md) semester to semester.
The goal is to give you a sense that teaching isn't easy and I'm very open to feedback.
