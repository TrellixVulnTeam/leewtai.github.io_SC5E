# Courses

Here're some courses I've taught before that will hopefully be decomposed into a concept map
for statistics.

- [Linear regression](linear_regression/README.md) for minors and majors the level of depth and speed are very different
- [Applied Statistical Computing](stat_computing/README.md) for minors and people who are not comfortable with the Command Line 

## Tutorials
- Going virtual
  - record lectures to Vimeo + YouKu (Chinese YouTube)
  - run lecture like discussion section
  - Use a writing pad

## Expectations for different degrees
Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to understand a problem, e.g. if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address issues with heteroskedasticity.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of the art methods
- A phd student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems

## Notes to self
Students' study patterns:
- (some) study first
- (most) hear it in class
- (all) do it
- (more than I thought) read it up again

This implies students want to have a textbook to follow.

How to create questions for homeworks/exams:
- Questions should try to blend 2 concepts into one to avoid pattern matching
- Questions should start from "what should the student be able to do/notice/correct with these concepts?"
