# Project 2: Working with spatial/temporal datasets and combining it with 3rd party data 

This project is built on top of a machine learning project [assassination classroom](../../../usecases_data/gps_assasination)

**In addition** to the requirements listed on the original project page, your second project needs
to also answer the following questions:
- Does the target walk faster or slower when the temperature is colder?
    - You'll need to get temperature data from an external source.
- Please visualize the unertainty in the target's position over time and space.
    - You do not need to cover the duration of the entire trip but this graph should
      help support your decision on the best time/location for assassinating the target.
    - You should not plot individual data points on this graph.
- Please highlight at least one data quality issues and how this impacts your conclusions.
