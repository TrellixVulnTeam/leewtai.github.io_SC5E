# Data collection

In a typical class, you won't have time to collect your own data so we
tend to avoid talking about data collection. However, this is one of the
most important steps in applied statistical work.

Consider [this article from The Orlando Sentinel](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-desantis-press-conference-20200619-cogedllclrelzfjlhafxgaoyii-story.html) that highlights the debates between the state and local governments
regarding approaches to mask wearing in Florida. It also mentions the
puzzling statistic that the median age of positive COVID-19
patients in Florida has dropped to late 20s (more than 20 years drop since March 2020).
How could this happen?

### Different forms of data collection
One of the most important aspect of data collection is its purpose.
Data collection is costly so its collection is often designed to target certain goals
with clever trade-offs are made.
Not understanding the original intent for the data collection can easily lead to
wrong conclusions. In this section, we will discuss some of the common goals for
data collection.

#### Experimental data
The classic data collection in most science classes are from running an experiment.
The goal is to falsify hypotheses, e.g. drug A does not help blood clotting, and
advance our scientific knowledge. This type of data is actually one of the hardest
to collect since running an experiment requires careful treatment assignment and
sample selection to make sure the conclusions are valid.

To achieve this, various variables have to be
collected but the very minimum would include the treatment status and the outcome.

The treatment status is what treatment was assigned to the subject which can differ
from what the subject actually experienced. The usual treatment is binary like treatment vs control
but can also be continuous like a dosage from a drug or number of seeds in the ground.

The outcome can include multiple values but is often a single variable like the count of
white blood cells (continuous), the number of deaths after 3 months (binary). This
variable can seem limitting at times but it is important to know the challenges that
can come along with measuring outcomes.

It is important to know that treatments and outcomes are not always feasible to
assign or measure either due to physical contraints or legal constraints.
For treatments, we cannot make subjects smoke knowing that it contains harmful substances.
We also cannot change someone's racial group if we wanted to study the impact of
perceived race on employment. For outcomes, accurate measurements in large scale
farming can prevent the harvest to finish in a timely manner and is not physically
feasible. Personal data should also be treated with care given the potential privacy
violations.

Besides the treatment and outcome, characterizing statistics is also common
within experimental data to help us understand its generality. Many psychology
experiments are ran on US undergraduate students and sometimes do not generalize
to other cultures, age groups, or education background.

#### Detecting patterns in data
An increasingly popular goal for data is to find patterns in the data that can
inform us of hypotheses to test, segment the users to target, or flag the anomalies
to fix. This is very different from the goal above because an experiment is
necessarily focused where pattern detection can be open-ended.

As mentioned before, data collection is often costly so even pattern detection
tasks would have some focus. The observation step within the scientific process
often will often focus


One of the most familiar pattern detection tasks is the observation step within
the scientific process. 
In the scientific process, the observation required to form a hypothesis can be
considered one of these tasks. To form a hypothesis, one would first need to understand
what is expected. For example, do we expect the percentage of men and women in a
city to be the same?


A classic anomaly in Tech companies is when a bug is introduced to the website that
breaks the original functionality. Business analyst often create funnels to understand
when customers are dropping off from their purchasing 

Data mining is a common word that has gained some popularity in data science that
is often poorly defined. The issue with this is
One of the most common tasks of a analyst is to monitor the company's operations
and create meaningful user segments that can 

#### Prediction
One of the most popular goals these days is to predict an outcome given data that
is more readily available. Many applications of machine learning




To form the hypotheses , scientists often observe patterns in
amounts of 

This is not an exhaustive list but here are some major classifications of the
different data collection activities.



### Common issues with data collection

#### Experiments that are not experiments
- p-fishing
- limited population

#### Understanding the limitation and value of case studies

#### What to know
- Always question the data quality
- Understand the original purpose of the data
- Understand the difference between the ideal and feasible dataset

#### Data quality
Data quality is a general term to describe whether the data can
serve the purpose.

#### General data compilation
- Wikipedia

#### Tracing
- COVID-19

#### Sampling
- Census
- Farm yields
