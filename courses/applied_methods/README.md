# Applied Statistical Methods

This is a placeholder page for a survey course on different applied statistical
topics. A survey course is not meant to give you a deep understanding into any
of the topics but to present the challenges that gave rise to the method and


## My assumption
You should know about
- What is linear regression and its different applications
  - its coefficients (and confidence intervals) could be used to infer about processes
  - the function can be used to predict new samples
- When is it not appropriate to apply the regression model
  - How to detect this
  - Why does a lot of features hurt us?
- How to improve regression
  - creating features (polynomials, interactions, etc)
  - feature selection
