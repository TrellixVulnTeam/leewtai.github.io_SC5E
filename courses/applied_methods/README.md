# Applied Statistical Methods

Applied Statistical Methods in Columbia's statistics concentration is meant for
students who have completed the linear regression and statistical computing
course. It is meant to give you a survey and practice of statistical methods
beyond the linear regression course.

## My assumption
You should know about
- What is linear regression and its different applications
  - its coefficients (and confidence intervals) could be used to infer about processes
  - the function can be used to predict new samples
- When is it not appropriate to apply the regression model
  - How to detect this
  - Why does a lot of features hurt us?
- How to improve regression
  - creating features (polynomials, interactions, etc)
  - feature selection
