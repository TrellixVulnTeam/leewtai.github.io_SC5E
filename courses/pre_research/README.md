# Pre-Research Seminar

Want to learn more about research? Not sure how to just knock on a professor's door and start?
The goal of this seminar is to give you a transition opportunity towards working on
some undergraduate research. The goal is at the end of the semester, you will
reach out to a professor to talk about a potential research opportunity
that you came up with.

If you are already doing research with a professor, this seminar isn't for you. Go do
your research :)
