# Linear Regression

Linear regression is the first class where data meets statistics meets programming.

From a programming standpoint, linear regression is a single line of code.
From a mathematically speaking, it's simply matrix multiplication.
Yet, linear regression is one of the foundational techniques that will
introduce the important concepts of inference and prediction.

I have some old materials online:
[syllabus for concentration](minor_syllabus.md)

[syllabus for major](major_syllabus.md)


## Key concepts
- The concept that multiple objective functions can be reasonable for prediction
- Understand the assumptions required to perform inference on the data generation process
- The concept of estimation, standard error, bias, mean squared error, sampling error
- The idea that we can still do inference with wrong models
- The ability to simulate wrong models
