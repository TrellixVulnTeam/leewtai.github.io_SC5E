# Applied Linear Regression Model
UN2103 - Spring 2020

### Expectations
#### - Learning outcomes
- Transition from learning via imitation to working backwards from the question
- Understand when to use linear regression for prediction or inference
- Be able to articulate counter examples for linear regression to fail
- Be able to simulate and confirm the mathematical derivations

#### - Your Job
  - Come to class, bring your laptop, take chances!
    - Run through the code and derivations in each lecture
    - Take summarized notes that augment the lectures
  - Give feedback in office hours or email, I don't want to waste your time
  - Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
    - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
    - Online: describe what you observe, describe what you expect, communicate clearly.
    - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.

### Logistics
Lectures:
  [TuTh 8:40pm - 9:55pm, Location: 627 Seeley W. Mudd Building](https://www.vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/)

Office Hours:
- Owen: M 3-4pm and W 4-5pm at the School of Social Works 10th Floor Lounge (1255 Amsterdam Ave)
- Wayne: Th 10am-Noon at 715 Watson Hall (612 W 115th St)


### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-97), you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+

#### - Homeworks (10%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
  - Homework solutions will exist in R
  - Your lowest homework grade will be dropped
  - No make-up homeworks will be granted even if you registered late to the class
#### - Exams (85%)
  - Midterms (15% for midterm 1 and 30% for Midterm 2)
  - Final (40%)
#### - Participation (5%)
  - This will be based on in-class online activities

### Prerequisites
  - Some familiarity with R or UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing
    - Need to know how to write a loop and simulate data from known distributions
  - An introductory statistics class
    - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
    - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
    - Properties of summary statistics
