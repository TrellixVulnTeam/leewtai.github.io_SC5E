#### Exercises

- For the following loop, please answer the questions
  ```r
  arbitrary_vec <- c(-1, 0, 1, -1)
  for(i in arbitrary_vec){
      print(i)
  }
  ```
  - What is the final value for `i`?
  - How many times have i been defined?
  - If I re-wrote the code above by replacing `i` with `element`, does the loop behave differently not defining a variable `i`?
