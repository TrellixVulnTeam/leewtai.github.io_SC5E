#### Exercises

For each line of code below, please articulate what are the
function names, inputs/arguments, how the inputs are passed
to the functions, and what are the consequences or outputs
of the function.

hint: `?FUNCTION_NAME` would be helpful for some of these

- `log(10, base=10)`
- `getwd()`
- `print("hello world")`
- `sample(10)`
- `demo_var <- 3.1415` (hint: `?"<-"`)
- Is subsetting, `[]` a function? (hint: `?"["`) If yes, explain its elements in the example
    ```r
    dice <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    dice[4]
    ```
