#### Exercises

Use the same `idaho` dataset that only has data after 2000.
Instead of `plot()`, let's explore how to make histograms
using the function `hist()`

Run the following command and answer the questions:
```r
hist(idaho$yield_bu_per_ac)
```

- What is the x vs y axis labels?
- How many data points was passed to the function `hist()`?
- What are the units for the x vs y axis?
- What is the range of data points passed to `hist()`?
- Is there a title for the histogram? How is it made?
