#### Exercises

- How can you subset only a single character from `substr()`, e.g. getting the 5th character in `hello`?
- What happens when you try to subset the 5th character when the string has fewer than 5 characters.
- Is `substr()` vectorized, i.e. if we pass the column as a vector as the first argument, would the outcome
  be the same as using the function?
  - What's the advantage of writing a function?
