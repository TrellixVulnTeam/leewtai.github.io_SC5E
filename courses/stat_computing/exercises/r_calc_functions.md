    - Warning, if you're in a console different from Jupyter Notebooks (like Rstudio), typing the above will not end in an error but notice how the console prompt has changed from > to a + . This is an indication that R believes you haven't finished typing in your commands. You can close this by typing in )  (so it runs successfully) or you end this by forcing an error (e.g. type in a character value like "a" that R is not anticipating).
