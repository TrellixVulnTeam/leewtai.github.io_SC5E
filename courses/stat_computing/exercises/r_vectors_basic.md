#### Exercises - variable assignment and creating vectors

- Create the vector 1 through 100 and assign it to the variable called `hundred` following the constraints below:
  - First, assign the value, 1, to a variable called `start`
  - Second, assign the value, 10, to a variable called `end`
  - Third, use `:` and `<-` to create the vector `hundred`
- Create a vector with the values `"UN2102"`, `"is"`, `"about"`, `"statistical"`, and `"computing"`.
- Create a vector of length 11 where every value is `""` (the empty character)
- Create a vector of length 7 where every value is `0`
