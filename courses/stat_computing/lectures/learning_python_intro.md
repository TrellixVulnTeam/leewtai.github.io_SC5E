# Learning Python through Translation

One of the key differences about these notes is that we will constantly be
translating the programming concepts into human language and mathematics so
you practice translating concepts into code rather than following instructions.

The table below will have each concept, linked to a detailed explanation for
each concept.

<table>
<tr>
  <td>Coding concept</td>
  <td>programming example</td>
  <td>Use case example</td>
  <td>statistics example</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Variables</td>
  <td><pre>
  n = 10
  print(n)
  sum(range(n))
  </pre></td>
  <td>
  N is used to estimate the cost of sampling, the
  uncertainty of our hypothetical sample average, and to calculate the
  sample average. We want the same value used throughout so we give it
  a name, the sample size.
  </td>
  <td>
  $$n = 10$$
  $$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \sum_{j=1}^n j$$
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
