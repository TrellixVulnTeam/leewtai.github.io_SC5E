# Learning Python through Translation

One of the key differences about these notes is that we will constantly be
translating the programming concepts into human language and mathematics so
you practice translating concepts into code rather than following instructions.

The table below will have each concept, linked to a detailed explanation for
each concept.

<table>
<tr>
  <td>Coding concept</td>
  <td>programming example</td>
  <td>Use case example</td>
  <td>statistics example</td>
</tr>
  <td>Variables</td>
  <td>

    ```python
    n = 10
    print(n)
    m = n / 2
    ```

  </td>
  <td>

  If our sample size is $$n$$, then we need to divide the total by the
  same number, also referred as $$n$$, to get the sample average.

  </td>
  <td>

  $$n = 10$$
  $$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \sum_{j=1}^n j$$

  </td>
</tr>
