# Applied Statistical Computing

One of the essential skills for Applied Statistics is a basic familiarity in
- collecting and manipulating data
- analyzing data in different segments

For people who purely want to learn data analysis with minimal amount of
Computer Science background, I've written some notes to help:
- [Learning R through Examples and Errors](lectures/learning_r_intro.md). After
  going through these notes, you should be able to
  - Collect data from the internet
  - Manipulate the messy data into an easy-to-analyze format
  - Summarize/plot data efficiently
- TODO, have another set of notes that focuses on statistical computing
  - Empirically verifying theoretical ideas
  - Estimating probabilities using simulations
  - Bootstrap/cross validating etc
  - Basic lessons on distributed computing

## Past Course Materials

Here's the [syllabus from Spring 2020](syllabus.md) that also has links to
some videoed lectures during the COVID-19 Shelter in Place.
