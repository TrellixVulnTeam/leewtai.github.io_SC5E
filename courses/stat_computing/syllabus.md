# Applied Statistical Computing
UN2102 - Spring 2020

### Learning outcomes
- Manipulate data with different structures
- Explore data via visualization
- Tackle familiar statistical concepts using simulations
- Work backwards vs learning via imitation
- Write reproducible code
- Debug code


### Expectations
- Come to class, bring your laptop, take chances!
  - Run through the code in lecture
  - Take notes that augment the lectures
- Give feedback in office hours or e-mail, don't waste your time if you think a topic is not helpful
- Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
  - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
  - Online: describe what you observe, describe what you expect, communicate clearly.
  - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.

### Logistics
Lectures:
  [TuTh 4:10pm - 5:25pm, Location: TBD](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/APPLIED%20STATISTICAL%20COMPUTING)

Office Hours:
  TBD

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-97), you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+ in this class.

#### - Homeworks (15%)
- Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
- Homework solutions will exist in R
- Your lowest homework grade will be dropped (this is for students who add this course late)
  - No make-up homeworks will be granted even if you registered late to the class

#### - Exams (80%)
- Midterms (25% each)
- Final (30%)

#### - Participation (5%)
- This will be based on in-class online activities

##### Exam accomodations
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations for this course, students must first be registered with their school Disability Services (DS) office. Detailed information is available online for both the [Columbia](https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) and Barnard registration processes.

Refer to the appropriate website for information regarding deadlines, disability documentation requirements, and [drop-in hours](https://health.columbia.edu/getting-care/drop-offices/disability-services-drop-hours)(Columbia)/[intake session]() (Barnard).

 

For this course, students are not required to have testing forms or accommodation letters signed by faculty. However, students must do the following:

·         The Instructor section of the form has already been completed and does not need to be signed by the professor.

·         The student must complete the Student section of the form and submit the form to Disability Services.

·         Master forms are available in the Disability Services office or online: https://health.columbia.edu/services/testing-accommodations


### Prerequisites
- An introductory statistics class
  - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
  - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, etc
- Some understanding of Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets

### Textbooks / Supplies
[The Art of R Programming: Tour of Statistical Software Design](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/13882895?counter=1) is available through CLIO
