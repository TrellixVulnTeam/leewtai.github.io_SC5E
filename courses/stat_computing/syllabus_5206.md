### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-97), you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I will not give out A+ for this class.

#### - Homeworks (25%)
- Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
- Homework solutions will exist in R
- No make-up homeworks will be granted even if you registered late to the class
- Please export all homeworks in PDF files following these [instructions](../../setup/math_and_code.md)
  - If you want to learn how to set up Jupyter Notebooks with R, follow these [instructions](../../setup/conda_and_navigator_setup.md)

#### - Exams (75%)
- Midterms (30%)
- Final (45%)


##### Exam accomodations
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations for this course, students must first be registered with their school Disability Services (DS) office. Detailed information is available online for both the [Columbia](https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) and Barnard registration processes.

Refer to the appropriate website for information regarding deadlines, disability documentation requirements, and [drop-in hours](https://health.columbia.edu/getting-care/drop-offices/disability-services-drop-hours)(Columbia)/[intake session]() (Barnard).

 

For this course, students are not required to have testing forms or accommodation letters signed by faculty. However, students must do the following:

·         The Instructor section of the form has already been completed and does not need to be signed by the professor.

·         The student must complete the Student section of the form and submit the form to Disability Services.

·         Master forms are available in the Disability Services office or online: https://health.columbia.edu/services/testing-accommodations


### Prerequisites
- An introductory statistics class
  - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
  - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, etc
- Multivariate calculus
  - Derivatives and functions
- Matrix operations and inverses of matrices

## Expectations
- Take chances!
  - Break the code in lecture
- Give feedback in office hours or e-mail, don't waste your time if you think a topic is not helpful
- Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
  - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
  - Online: describe what you observe, describe what you expect, communicate clearly.
  - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.
- Academic honesty: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/
