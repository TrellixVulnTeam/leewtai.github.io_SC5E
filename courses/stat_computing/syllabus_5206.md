### People and times
- Instructor: Wayne Tai Lee (wtl2109)
  - Class time: [TuTh 6:10pm - 8:55pm, Location: TBD](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/APPLIED%20STATISTICAL%20COMPUTING)
  - Office Hours: TBD

- Teaching Assistant(s):
  - TBD
  - TBD

### Course format
During this special semester, we will have a flipped classroom format that combines online and in-person sessions.
- Online
  - Lectures will be pre-recorded and posted online. You will be expected to watch these before class time.
- In-person 
  - Discussions during class time (twice a week)
    - For each class, we will break out into groups to work on problems that utilize the concepts covered by the online
      videos.
    - Groups will be asked to present their solution
    - You can participate online via breakout rooms for this but coordinating with your peers will be easier in-person.
  - Exams (twice a semester)
    - All exams will be in person by default 
  - Mock interviews with data analysis (once a week starting the week of 11/16) during the optional discussion section
    - This is a peer-evaluated data analysis mock interview. Each Friday, students will be assigned into random pairs to
      meet in person. One student will perform basic data analysis to a new dataset within 45 minute and present the results
      where the other student will be given rules and questions to conduct the interview. Debriefs will be discussed
      in class.

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-97), you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I will not give out A+ for this class.

#### - Homeworks (25%)
- Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
- Homework solutions will exist in R
- No make-up homeworks will be granted even if you registered late to the class
- Please export all homeworks in PDF files following these [instructions](../../setup/math_and_code.md)
  - If you want to learn how to set up Jupyter Notebooks with R, follow these [instructions](../../setup/conda_and_navigator_setup.md)

#### - Exams (75%)
- Midterms (30% each)
- Final (45%)


##### Exam accomodations
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations for this course, students must first be registered with their school Disability Services (DS) office. Detailed information is available online for both the [Columbia](https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) and Barnard registration processes.

Refer to the appropriate website for information regarding deadlines, disability documentation requirements, and [drop-in hours](https://health.columbia.edu/getting-care/drop-offices/disability-services-drop-hours)(Columbia)/[intake session]() (Barnard).

 

For this course, students are not required to have testing forms or accommodation letters signed by faculty. However, students must do the following:

·         The Instructor section of the form has already been completed and does not need to be signed by the professor.

·         The student must complete the Student section of the form and submit the form to Disability Services.

·         Master forms are available in the Disability Services office or online: https://health.columbia.edu/services/testing-accommodations


### Prerequisites
- An introductory statistics class
  - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
  - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, etc
- Multivariate calculus
  - Derivatives and functions
- Matrix operations and inverses of matrices

## Expectations
- Take chances!
  - Break the code in lecture
- Give feedback in office hours or e-mail, don't waste your time if you think a topic is not helpful
- Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
  - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
  - Online: describe what you observe, describe what you expect, communicate clearly.
  - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.
- Academic honesty: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/
