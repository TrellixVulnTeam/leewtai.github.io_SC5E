# Teaching reflections
The notes are organized by semester for now.

## Semester Fall 2019

#### Context
- First time officially teaching full time
- 2 Courses on Linear Regression (Senior + MA students totally 120 students)
- 1 Course on Applied Statistical Methods (23 students)

#### Trials
- The Ed teaching platform
  - Can host lecture materials
  - Notebooks/Rstudio/terminal
  - Auto-grading
  - Enabled coding in exams with the help of Secure Exam Browser
- Teaching without a textbook
- Teaching regression from D. Freedman + Simulation standpoint
- Final exam was all multiple choies
- Exams/questions were made by blending 2+ concepts into one problem to avoid pattern matching
- In-class quizzes/surveys were useful for attendance
- Completely changed Applied Stat Methods given the background of the students
- Tried an oral exam for the final for Applied methods

#### What went well?
- Students were very active in office hours (they made friends!)
- Students who stayed with the course found their lessons very useful in the next class
- Some students sent very nice notes
- Students could see how the problems were relevant in the future
- I enjoyed teaching about wrong models
- I think the oral exam final after a final project is a good system!
- No grade complaints

#### What went poorly?
- Need to rethink about ANOVA
- Students wanted to quit in the semester (dropout was high)
- Evaluations were suboptimal
- Wording on many exams/homeworks caused unnecessary confusion and stress
- First midterm was too hard (coding cannot be half of the exam)
- The top students definitely got more out of the class
- Small amount of cheating happened
- Students like to ask questions after class but not during class

#### Reflections
- Evaluations are hard, they pressure instructors to lower the standard
  and make courses less relevant to the real world.
- Students' study patterns:
  - (some) study first
  - (most) hear it in class
  - (all) do it
  - (more than I thought) read it up again
- Students want to have a textbook to follow.
- Grading is still painful
- Need to standardize the concentration for Stat Department
- Students code a lot slower than I thought (5x)
- Using Ed for lectures might be too much
- TAs were helpful but can be more so...


## Semester Spring 2020

#### Context
- Applied Stat Computing (90)
- Applied Linear Regression (9)
- Advised one QMSS student
  - are women included on online conversations?
- Advised one undergrad researcher
  - ranking wrestlers with lots of missing values
- Helped out with MA reading group

#### Trials
- Wanted to transition from Excel to R using Fisher's dataset
- Wrote a [learning R through examples](stat_computing/lectures/learning_r_intro.md) for future references
  with hopes to strike a balance between examples and CS rigor. Intentionally avoided tidyverse
- Lots of datasets (Fisher's experiment, planting date from text, airport connections, NYC salary,
  historical corn yields per state, COVID death + confirmed cases, course descriptions from Columbia, NYC 311,
  job descriptions, twitter, grade distributions from Madison)
- Tried Github pages + Ed (exam was tough with Rstudio on Ed)
- Advising undergrad on collecting data
- Made videos for lecture

#### What went poorly?
- First breakout room was a fail (no one spoke!)
- Gave up on quizzes midway due to COVID, should have continued
- Final projects from regression was below expectation, need to add more real examples
- Ed avoids some issues for students (it's too good for an intro class).

#### What went well?
- Lots of students who didn't know programming learned R 
- Lots of exposure to different datasets
- Discussions in lecture time seemed better
- Ed does avoid a lot of package dependency issues for students
- I think it's the right choice to focus on data wrangling than algorithms

#### Reflection
- We should restrict the type of R functions allowed on some exams, students have a lot of copy/paste
  from online which prevents them from understanding the underlying data. A lot of effort is spent
  in the wrong dimensions.
- Maybe it's better to ask the researchers to mentor the next generation researchers (so 2 semester cycles)
  as part of the agreement
- Making exams take a lot of time
- Academic honesty issues were not noticeable, maybe because P/F only.
- Some students asked more questions online, some just stopped showing up to class.
- Responding to multi-day exams is tiring (Victor recommended letting people ask questions up front)
- Might try to teach students to reproduce each other's reports
