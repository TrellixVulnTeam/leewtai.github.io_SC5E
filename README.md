I'm Wayne, a statistician with a huge passion in statistics education and modern dance.
I've worked as a professional data scientist in agriculture, social networks, and aerospace.

My current goals are to make useful statistics a mandatory subject in high school education.
There are many reasons why I think this will make the world a better place :)


#### Courses and Experiments
For course materials, please see the following:
- [Applied Statistical Computing](courses/stat_computing/README.md)
- [Linear Regression](courses/linear_regression/README.md)
- [Applied statistical methods beyond linear regression](courses/applied_methods/README.md)
- Interdisciplinary Seminar Ideas
- [Going virtual with recordings (in-progress)](courses/going_virtual.md)

There are three statistical concepts that I would like to teach to the world:
- There exist data and non-data problems
- Coming up with "What else"?
- What data can change my opinion?

I'm slowly compiling a statistics concept inventory overtime:
- [Intro Stat Concepts](stat_concept_inv/README.md)

#### Applied Research Interest
I'm always open to collaborations related to applied statistics, statistics education, or data science
aimed to better the world.

If you are an undergraduate/MA student who wants to do research, I encourage you to bring your own
topic but I also have a [list of ideas](./usecases_data).


### Thoughts & Writing
I have several thoughts around statistics, data science, dance, and life if you care to read about them:

- [3 Statistical Concepts to Save the World](https://medium.com/@leewtai/3-statistical-concepts-to-save-the-world-d8cdf0534f35)
- [Model like a model](https://medium.com/swlh/modeling-like-a-model-957933b55785)

#### Manager/instructor philosophy
If you are my report or student, I want our relationship to be built on the understanding
that you could be my manager or instructor in the future.

Above all, I value curiosity, empathy, and integrity because I believe these qualities
lead to a creative, respectful, and robust future.  I am not an easy manager/instructor
because I will have high expectations/hopes for you. If I give you any feedback, you should demand what
evidence I'm basing those judgements on. If I am wasting your time, let me know and I
will change. Please know that it is my job to help you articulate problems that you might
be struggling to articulate so you shouldn't worry if you're not sure what is bother you profesionally.

You should know what you're giving up to be on my team or in my class/team. I view your future growth
as part of my responsibility, even outside the institution we work in. I've helped most of my reports
seek and assess new opportunities. The most important skill you should
aquire is a solid foundation and support network that allows you to learn, explore, and make mistakes.
I will always be your ally in this aspect.

In exchange, I want you to reciprocate and pass on this management philosophy or develop your own.
