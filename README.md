## Wayne Tai Lee's Projects

Hello there, I'm a statistician with a huge passion in education. I've worked as a professional data
scientist mostly in agriculture (and dabbled in social networks and aerospace) over 6 years.

### Teaching

I'm quite new to teaching and am excited about all the research in STEM education that I've never
learned about in grad school.
