I'm Wayne, a statistician with a huge passion in statistics education and modern dance.
I've worked as a professional data scientist in agriculture, social networks, and aerospace.

My current goals are to make useful statistics a mandatory subject in high school education all over the world.
There are many reasons why I think this will make the world a better place.

#### Teaching and Side Projects
I teach courses with a applied focus. I believe that applied work is not
"easier" given that you are constantly making trade-offs and knowing some theory
really helps you understand how your
decisions will impact your goals.

My teaching philosophy is actually heavily influenced by my dance background:
- We learn through imitation
- We learn by contrasting old vs new learnings and our own vs other people's perspectives
- We learn by trying to articulate our own ideas

You can find a [list of my courses](courses/README.md) that source material
from several [applied projects](usecases_data/README.md).

There are three statistical concepts that I would like to teach to the world:
- There exist data and non-data problems
- Coming up with "What else" could explain the same dataset?
- The ability to list out the data that can change your opinion?

I'm slowly compiling a [statistics concept inventory](stat_concept_inv/README.md)
overtime.


### Thoughts & Writing
I have several thoughts around statistics, data science, dance, and life if you care to read about them:
