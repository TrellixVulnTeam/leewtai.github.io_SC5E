## Hello world

Hello there! This is Wayne, a statistician with a huge passion in education and dance.
I've worked as a professional data scientist in agriculture, social networks, and aerospace.

My current goals are to make useful statistics a mandatory subject in high school education.
There are many reasons why I think this can make the world a better place :)


## Teaching
#### Courses and Experiments
The following courses will hopefully be constructed from a collection of concepts above.
- [Applied Statistical Computing](courses/stat_computing/README.md)
- [Linear Regression](courses/linear_regression/README.md)
- [Applied statistical methods beyond linear regression](courses/applied_methods/README.md)
- [Going virtual with recordings (in-progress)](courses/going_virtual.md)

#### Concepts
There are three statistical concepts that I would like to teach:
- Data and non-data problems
- Coming up with "What else"?
- What data can change my opinion?

I'm slowly compiling certain concepts overtime:
- [Intro Stat Concepts](stat_concept_inv/README.md)

## Applied Research Ideas With Students
- An App to tie problems and concepts together to help
  make problems
- Anything agriculture tech!
- Supply chain optimization with spatial statistics
- Finding experts within a field
- Dance + tech

## Thoughts & Writing
I have several thoughts around statistics, data science, dance, and life if you care to read about them:
