### Hello world

Hello there! This is Wayne, a statistician with a huge passion in education and dance.
I've worked as a professional data scientist in agriculture, social networks, and aerospace.

My current goals are to make useful statistics a mandatory subject in high school education.
There are many reasons why I think this can make the world a better place :)


### Teaching
Many friends have commented on the desire to learn statistics better yet also showed a lot of
frustration in the typical statistical curriculum. The desire is often a result of being
surprised by data at work where the frustration is often from the disconnect between the classic
statistics curriculum and these surprises. Resolving this conflict is my initial goal in statistics
education.


#### Concept Inventory
If there's one lesson in data science, it's about creating meaningful feedback loops to guide
you towards the desired end-goal. For statistics education, I believe this feedback can be
achieved by developing a statistics concept inventory. We need to know if changes
result in measurable improved understanding for the students. A lot of EdTech solutions
seem to focus on ease of access or administration rather than the outcome of students.

A [concept inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_inventory) is a collection of
multiple-choice questions to assess students' working knowledge of a specific set of concepts.
They should have representative coverage of the material, should not focus on derivations, and
the distractors should be developed from common misconceptions. 

I'll hopefully have some updates on how I wish to tackle this issue more practically using
my learnings from the courses I teach below.

#### Courses
The following courses will hopefully be constructed from a collection of concepts above.
- [Applied Statistical Computing](courses/stat_computing/README.md)
- [Linear Regression](courses/linear_regression/README.md)
- Applied statistical methods beyond 


### Thoughts & Writing
I have several thoughts around statistics, data science, dance, and life if you care to read about them:
